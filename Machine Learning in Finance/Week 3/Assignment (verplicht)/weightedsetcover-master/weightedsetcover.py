    '''Weighted set cover greedy algorithm:
    pick the set which is the most cost-effective: min(w[s]/|s-C|),
    where C is the current covered elements set.

    The complexity of the algorithm: O(|U| * log|S|) .
    Finding the most cost-effective set is done by a priority queue.
    The operation has time complexity of O(log|S|).

    Input:
    udict - universe U, which contains the <elem, setlist>. (dict)
    S - a collection of sets. (list)
    w - corresponding weight to each set in S. (list)

    Output:
    selected: the selected set ids in order. (list)
    cost: the total cost of the selected sets.
